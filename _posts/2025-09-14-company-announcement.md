Across enterprises, scaleups, and nonprofits, leaders are asking for security programs that are measurable, pragmatic, and aligned to strategy. 

LemurSec exists to turn that into reality by blending senior advisory (GRC, OpenFAIR, COBIT, CRISC) with hands-on technical validation (OSCP, CCSK; application/API testing, code review, external network assessments, cloud posture, OT/ICS).
