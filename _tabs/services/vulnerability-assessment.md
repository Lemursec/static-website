## Validate Controls, Reduce Lateral Risk

### Architectural review, credentialed scanning, and targeted validation to harden your internal attack surface.

This assessment measures how well your network defenses actually perform. We review architecture and controls, run credentialed vulnerability scanning, validate high-risk findings manually, and test segmentation where it matters (e.g., crown-jewel paths, privileged access, remote access). 

The output is a prioritized remediation plan that your MSP or IT team can execute, plus an executive brief that translates risk to business impact. Map results to NIST CSF/COBIT/ISO 27001 and use them for cyber-insurance, audits, or board updates.

## Who it’s for
Organizations needing an annual network checkup, insurer evidence, or validation after major changes/migrations.
