## Code security review via Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools and OWASP methodology and secure coding practices.

*Senior AppSec staff with a background in full-stack Enterprise software development review your software repository source code against OWASP guidance with developer-ready fixes, CI recommendations, and a rapid diff/retest of your remediation efforts.*

## Overview
This engagement delivers a pragmatic, senior-led secure code review that goes beyond automated scanners. We combine targeted static analysis with manual reasoning about your authentication/authorization flows, input validation, data handling, crypto usage, file and process boundaries, and risky software development patterns.

We examine high-risk modules first (authentication, authorization, secrets handling), evaluate dependency and configuration hygiene, and analyze PR history to spot recurring anti-patterns. Findings map to OWASP ASVS and the OWASP Top Ten and include evidence, CWE references, and code-level remediation guidance.

You get an executive brief, a developer report with concrete fixes, and CI guardrails to prevent regressions, plus a quick follow-up review of your remediation diffs.

## Tailored for Engineering/DevOps Teams
Whether you are preparing for enterprise reviews, major releases, or you want source code security audit evidence with actionable, code-level remediation guidance.

| Risk-ranked findings, affected files/code sections                                                       |
| Code line-number specific remediation guidance and safer development patterns                            |
| Authentication/Authorization, session, input/output handling, SSRF, injection, deserialization reviews   |
| Secrets & crypto checks (key management, randomness, hashing/crypto APIs and their implementations)      |
| Dependency & configuration hygiene, optional SBOM and update plan                                        |
| CI guardrails (pre-commit/CI rules, sample Semgrep policies) to prevent regressions                      |
| Executive summary + developer report; remediation workshop                                               |
| Remediation diff review (verification of code bug fixes)                                                 |
