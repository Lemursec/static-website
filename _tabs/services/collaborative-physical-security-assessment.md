## Guided-Tour Facilities Walkthrough

### Senior Red Team practitioners lead an in-person tour with safe, live demonstrations and deliver clear observations and recommendations.

This hands-on engagement brings your facilities, security, and operations leaders together with senior Red Team staff for a guided site walkthrough. We demonstrate realistic, but safe, physical attack paths (e.g., tailgating risk discussion, physical and electronic access controls, badge misuse scenarios, and common bypass pitfalls) under pre-approved Rules of Engagement. 

The focus is coaching and capacity-building, not *"gotchas."*

You'll see what works, what doesn't, and which quick fixes meaningfully reduce risk. We document observations with photos, severity ratings, and pragmatic recommendations aligned to your environment and policies. We deliver a prioritized plan your team can execute immediately.

## Who it’s for
Organizations seeking a collaborative, training-oriented assessment of facilities without covert testing.
