## Remote-Only Campaigns

### Credentialed SE operators (SEPP) run phishing, phone, chat, and AI chatbot elicitation to measure susceptibility and improve reporting culture.

Are you preparing for customer reviews or maturing your organizational security awareness & response?

Measure human-layer risk with a controlled, remote-only social engineering program. We design realistic pretexts, run email phishing campaigns and conduct phone/chat elicitation against pre-approved targets, including AI chatbots. We don't intentionally collect sensitive personal data or credentials beyond agreed indicators.


Every step adheres to law, policy, and your Rules of Engagement. You'll receive campaign metrics (open/click/report rates), sample transcripts, and a prioritized improvement plan for future awareness training. The aim is culture change: more reporting, fewer risky actions, and better defensive muscle memory.
