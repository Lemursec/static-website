## Find your security gaps before adversaries do

*We identify and baseline your internet-facing asset vulnerabilities, exposures, and quick-win remediations.*

## Expose and eliminate hidden risks in your public-facing digital footprint.
We help small-to-mid-sized businesses and nonprofits discover what adversaries may already know, and close the gaps fast. Going beyond typical automated scanning, it's a methodical, analyst-guided service designed for teams that lack continuous attack surface monitoring or are navigating recent growth.

## Uncover What Others Miss
We take a meticulous approach to mapping your internet-facing assets, including domains, apps, cloud services, and infrastructure. We test and validate exposures attackers could exploit. From misconfigurations and open ports to expired certs and development artifacts, we uncover vulnerabilities before they turn into headlines.

## Tailored for Teams on the Move
Whether you're growing through M&A, cloud migration, or brand expansion, we help you take control of your external surface. Ideal for teams without mature Attack Surface Management coverage, our approach gives you the clarity and confidence to act.
