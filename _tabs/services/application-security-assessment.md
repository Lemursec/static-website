## Deep testing across auth flows, APIs, and business logic with developer-ready fixes. Retesting included.

*We focus on the vulnerabilities scanners miss*


Testing covers web UI plus REST/GraphQL APIs, evaluates cloud storage and secrets handling, and targets high-impact issues like SSRF, object deserialization, and access control bypass.

LemurSec additionally tests for broken authorization (IDOR/BOLA), complex auth flows (SSO/OAuth/OIDC) abuse/bypass, session management, input handling, file uploads, rate limiting, and business-logic abuse.

Findings include evidence, reproducible steps, CVSS scoring, and code-level remediation guidance. Work maps to OWASP Top 10 / ASVS and NIST CSF so one assessment supports multiple compliance drivers.

You'll receive an executive summary report for leadership and a detailed technical appendix your engineers can immediately action, followed by a remediation retest/report update, when scheduled within 10 business days.

## Designed for SaaS and regulated SMBs
**Are you prepping for an annual/required test?** This service helps you remediate findings early and prepare for enterprise reviews, major releases, annual penetration testing/security assessment, or cyber-insurance audits.
