## Audit-Ready in 4 Weeks


### A proven, accelerated path to SOC 2 compliance readiness. Built for SMBs and nonprofits who can’t afford to waste time.

*Gap assessment, control-to-stack mapping, prioritized roadmap, and sales-ready evidence, without derailing your sprints.*

## Clear Value, Fast Results
**Get audit-ready without slowing down.** Our 4-week SOC 2 Readiness Sprint gives you a structured path: gap assessment, control-to-stack mapping, and a prioritized roadmap your team can actually execute. You’ll walk away with sales-ready evidence and the clarity to face audits, security questionnaires, and cyber-insurance renewals with confidence.

## What Makes Us Different
**We compress the SOC 2 ramp.** In just four weeks, you’ll gain a clear view of control gaps, a cloud-aligned map (AWS/GCP/Azure), and a minimum viable set of policies to satisfy first-time auditors and enterprise reviewers. With an executive one-pager for sales teams and alignment to NIST CSF/ISO 27001, your investments will pay off across multiple frameworks, beyond just SOC 2.

## Who It’s For & How It Works
**Designed for SMBs and nonprofits.** Whether you’re a SaaS startup facing your first customer review or a nonprofit preparing for cyber-insurance, our sprint model gets you ready fast. Each week is focused and practical: discovery, control mapping, policy creation, and final review with clear next steps. Achieve a predictable scope, faster audits, and fewer questionnaire fire drills.

- Gap analysis with maturity scores
- Control-to-stack map (AWS/GCP/Azure)  
- Prioritized remediation roadmap  
- 3 essential policies (Access, Change, Incident)
