## Realistic Adversary Simulation

### Comprehensive logical security assessment inclusive of covert entry of facilities across one or more sites, executed by OSCP and SEPP credentialed professionals.

Test your organization the way a determined adversary would, within tightly controlled legal and safety boundaries. We combine external and internal intrusion attempts (cloud/app/identity) with covert physical entry windows at one or more sites to pursue agreed-upon objectives: access to crown-jewel data, privileged systems, or sensitive spaces. 

Our operators (credentialed OSCP & SEPP) follow strict Rules of Engagement, chain-of-custody, and emergency abort criteria. You'll receive an attack narrative, artifacts, and a prioritized remediation plan, plus detection/response observations for your SOC/IT. The result is evidence of actual blast radius and a clear path to hardening identity, endpoints, networks, and facilities.

## Who it’s for
Mature teams seeking a realistic, cross-domain assessment to validate controls and incident response.

| External → internal logical intrusion attempts (cloud/app/identity)    |
| Covert physical entry windows (pre-authorized, non-destructive)        |
| Objective-based “flags” (evidence of access) & artifacts               |
| XDR/SIEM detection & response observations                             |
| Attack narrative, photos, timeline, and prioritized fixes              |
